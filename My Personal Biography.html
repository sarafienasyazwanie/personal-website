<p> My name is Nursarafiena Syazwanie Binti Suhaimi. Usually people will call me Fiena. 
<br> I am from Kangar, Perlis. I was born in 29 September 1999 at Hospital Besar Kangar. 
<br> I have 3 siblings including me and I am the only daughter in my family. </P>

<ol> I would describe myself as :
   <li> Reliable
   <li> Team-oriented person
   <li> Committed

<p> I said I am reliable because my family and friends can count on me.
<br> I am always the first person that my friends call because they know I am always there for them. 
<br> Being the only girl in my family, my parents always rely on me in doing house-chores, helping them
<br> in coping with technological changes and other things.
<br> Night or day, I make sure to take care of the people in my life. I put the same effort into 
<br> making sure my work is done correctly, and I am always available to help my team members.
 
<p> Next, I can work with people very well even though I don't know them. I can easily communicate and make friend with them.
<br> Being a team oriented person, I am responsible and I can do my task very well. I can always help and support my teams.
<br> In addition, once I start doing my task, I become very committed. I won't leave my workspace unless I finished doing my task.
<br> I am someone who strives to complete my task on time and someone who would push herself out of her comfort zone.
<br> I have so many thing to achieve and I can endure whatever weighing me down in order to make my dreams into reality.

<p> Hobbies are our daily lives activities which we must do. It helps us to get escaped from the daily crush of life. 
<br> It gives us immense pleasure and peace of body, mind and soul. </p>
<p>
<br> My hobbies are :

<ul> 
   <li> Listening to music has always been my go to activity. </li>
